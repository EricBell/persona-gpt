The Flask secret key is used to cryptographically sign session cookies.

  What it does:
  - Flask stores session data in cookies on the client's browser
  - The secret key signs these cookies so they can't be tampered with
  - If someone modifies the cookie, the signature won't match and Flask rejects it

  In this app, it protects:
  - query_count - prevents users from resetting their query limit by editing the cookie
  - conversation - prevents manipulation of chat history

  How to generate one:

  python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

  Or:

  uv run python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

  Important:
  - Must be kept secret (in .env, never committed)
  - Should be a long random string (32+ bytes)
  - If it changes, all existing sessions become invalid
  - The default dev-secret-key-change-in-production in the code is only for local testing - production must use a real random key


I want to permit any LLM to be used if possible. Is this a job for OpenRouter. If so, how? and is there a cost to using OpenRouter that is too much?

What do you think—ready to add one or two more (e.g., a trading tool like backtester or trading-journal ecosystem, the transcript-from-audio tool, or Dokploy VPS migration)? Or tweak any of these? Or move to another resume section (e.g., Professional Summary, Leadership/Community, Education/Certifications)? Let me know!/s

 so where is config.json mounted if at all on my server?                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
● Good question! Let me clarify the current state:                                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Current State (After My Fix)                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  config.json is NOT mounted to your server at all right now.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  Here's where it exists:                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Inside the Docker container: /data/config.json                                                                                                                                                                            
    - This file is baked into the image during build (copied from config.example.json)                                                                                                                                         
    - It's isolated inside the container, not connected to any host file                                                                                                                                                       
    - Default value: conversation_history_limit: 20                                                                                                                                                                            
  2. On your Dokploy server: Nowhere                                                                                                                                                                                           
    - The file doesn't exist on your host filesystem                                                                                                                                                                           
    - The volume mount line is commented out in docker-compose.yml                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  What This Means                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  - ✅ The app works (uses the built-in config.json from the image)                                                                                                                                                            
  - ❌ You can't edit it from your server (no hot-reload capability yet)                                                                                                                                                       
  - ✅ You can still configure it via environment variable CONVERSATION_HISTORY_LIMIT                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  To Enable Hot-Reload (Optional)                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  If you want to edit config.json on your server and have changes take effect immediately:                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  1. Create the file in Dokploy:                                                                                                                                                                                               
    - Go to your app's "Files" tab                                                                                                                                                                                             
    - Create: files/config.json                                                                                                                                                                                                
    - Content:                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    {                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    "conversation_history_limit": 5                                                                                                                                                                                            
  }                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  2. Uncomment the mount in docker-compose.yml (line ~47):

  After that, the file will be at: /etc/dokploy/compose/[your-app-id]/files/config.json on your server, and you can edit it for hot-reloading.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  But for now, just use the environment variable CONVERSATION_HISTORY_LIMIT=5 in Dokploy - it's simpler and works immediately.
